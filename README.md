# World_Weather_Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to retrieve weather data, create a customer travel destinations map, and create a travel itinerary. To do this 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes were generated and then used to retrieve the nearest city. Then an API call was performed with OpenWeatherMap to generate a dataframe with the city's country, latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, humidity level, cloudiness, wind speed, and the current description of the weather. With this information a weather heat map was create with city markers. To create the customer travel destinations map, input statements were used to retrieve customer weather preferences and those preferences were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then those destinations were shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Lastly, to create a travel itinerary I used the Google Directions API to create a marker layer map (with pop-up markers for each city) that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customer's possible travel destinations.
